  <h1>Socio-ecological research for biodiversity and climate resilience</h1>
  <p>Research Statement
My research pairs sociology and ecology to address biodiversity declines and climate change by studying the factors mediating insect communities and soil microbiomes within agroecosystems1-9. Researchers in my laboratory will leverage quantitative social and ecological theory to center farmers and policy makers as drivers of biodiversity and climate change resilience (Fig. 1).</p>

      <h2>Objective 1</h2>
      <p>Promoting biodiversity through process-based models: In the first year, my laboratory will finish the construction of a mechanistic beta diversity model I am developing leveraging preexisting data from 36 wild pollinator populations in the PNW1,2,5. During model development, my laboratory will establish a GA network of organic farmers along orthogonal gradients of landscape diversity, practices, and climate change patterns, and use listening sessions to quantify stakeholder needs6,7. Within 3 years my laboratory will establish a long-term molecular biodiversity monitoring program for insect pollinators, soil microbes, and predatory beetles, using pollen sequencing, shotgun metabarcoding, and gut content analysis to estimate function, respectively. Monitoring efforts will validate our beta diversity model by reaching asymptotic species detection limits, allowing for mechanistic partitioning across communities (e.g., species immigration), while training individualized biodiversity-ecosystem function decision support tools for farmers. These projects will seek funding from the NSF Biodiversity on a Changing Planet and USDA Sustainable Agricultural Systems programs.</p>

      <h2>Objective 2</h2>
      <p>Centering farmers as agents of change: Within 5 years, my lab will integrate social and macroecological theory by centering farmers and policy makers as drivers of biodiversity and climate change. Here, we will pair on-farm monitoring with surveys documenting farmer perceptions of ecosystem services6,7, creating bounded positive feedback, where changes in ecosystem services observed by farmers support the adoption of sustainable practices. Within 7 years, my laboratory will use national surveys to develop political incentives that reduce barriers to adopting organic agriculture and use meta-analysis to predict ecological outcomes. We will leverage my national connections with farmers to validate the model predictions2,3,6. Finally, I am increasingly interested in farmer wellbeing. Within 10 years, my laboratory will evaluate the causes of stress among farmer stakeholders, develop stress reduction extension programs, and evaluate the benefits of farmer wellbeing for biodiversity and climate change adaptation. For these projects, I will seek grants from the USDA Organic Research Extension Initiative and NIH National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health.</p>

      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>The qualitative and quantitative tools developed by my research are broadly applicable. This means my laboratory will be a hub of collaborations within and beyond UGA. At the same time, there is a need to train students in entomology and agroecology. My research program fills this niche by blending the social and ecological dimensions of macroecology, while promoting sustainable farming systems that meet the challenges of an uncertain future.
